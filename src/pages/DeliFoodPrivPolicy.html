            <strong>Data Security</strong>
            <p>We are committed to protecting your personal data. We use industry-standard security measures to safeguard your information, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Encryption: We use TLS/SSL to encrypt data transmitted between our servers and your browser. Sensitive data stored on our servers is also encrypted.</li>

                <li>Monitoring: Our systems are monitored for suspicious activities, and we have an incident response plan in place to handle potential breaches.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal data, no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. If you have any questions about the security of your data, please contact us at salomon1142608010@gmail.com.</p>
