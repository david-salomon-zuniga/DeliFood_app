## 4. Data Security

We are committed to protecting your personal data. We use industry-standard security measures to safeguard your information, including:

- **Encryption**: We use TLS/SSL to encrypt data transmitted between our servers and your browser. Sensitive data stored on our servers is also encrypted.

- **Regular Audits**: We conduct regular security audits and penetration tests to identify and address vulnerabilities.
- **Monitoring**: Our systems are monitored for suspicious activities, and we have an incident response plan in place to handle potential breaches.

While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal data, no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. If you have any questions about the security of your data, please contact us at salomon1142608010@gmail.com.
